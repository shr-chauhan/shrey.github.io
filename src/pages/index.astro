        I'm Shrey — I build systems, lead teams, and solve problems. Currently, I run engineering for Quantum’s USP and, in my free time, explore AI because it’s rewriting the rules of software engineering. When I'm not building things, you’ll find me chasing some sport or the other.

        I graduated from NIT Trichy in 2014 with a degree in Computer Science. During college, I led the dance team as its president, and many of my leadership qualities trace back to that experience. Navigating the team through victories, failures, and crises taught me resilience, responsibility, and how to inspire people.

        I'm a Senior Engineering Manager at Quantum, where I lead the Unified Surveillance Platform (USP) engineering team. USP is Quantum's optimized hyperconverged infrastructure solution for large-scale video surveillance.

        Before this, I was one of the founding engineers at EnCloudEn, where I led engineering for our virtual desktop, private cloud, and HCI platforms. I joined as the second engineer, became Director of Engineering, and helped grow a 15-member team that built the technology foundation that ultimately led to EnCloudEn's acquisition by Quantum.

          AI is the biggest buzzword in tech today, and like many engineers, I've been diving deep into it. Since my day-to-day work doesn't revolve around AI, I began taking on side projects to learn, experiment, and document my progress. I genuinely believe that AI is something every software engineer should explore, because it marks a major paradigm shift in how we build software—We've moved from machine code to assembly to high-level languages… and now to AI-assisted development. <a href="/ai" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300 hover:underline">More on AI</a>
